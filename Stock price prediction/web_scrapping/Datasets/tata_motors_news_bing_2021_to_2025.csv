The company said its sales in the domestic and international market for Q3 FY22 stood at 1,99,633 vehicles, compared to 1,58,218 units during Q3 FY21.

Tata Motors’ commercial vehicle domestic sale in Q3 stood at 90,529 units, which was 15% higher than the previous quarter (Q2 FY22) and 10% higher than the same quarter last year (Q3 FY21).

“The retail was ahead of whole sale by 15% in December’21, enabling inventory alignment,” Tata Motors said.

The auto giant said the SCV and ILCV segments continued to benefit from the growth in “e-commerce and the increasing need for last-mile delivery”.

“Construction and infrastructure spending by central and state governments plus rising activity in sectors such as mining, petroleum-oil-lubricants and allied industries facilitated the demand for M&HCVs. The International business too continued its recovery momentum and grew by 10% over the previous quarter (Q2 FY22) and 33% over the same quarter last year (Q3 FY21),” Tata Motors said in a statement.

The company expects the situation to remain “fluid” in the near future as the issues such as semiconductor shortage, rise in Covid cases and underlying demand continues to create hurdles.

""We are keeping a close watch on the evolving situation and sharpening our agile, multi-pronged approach to fulfil customer orders,” Tata Motors said.",2022-01-01 15:45:15+05:30
https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/car-news/may-2021-car-sales-tata-motors-registers-38-reduction-in-domestic-sales-due-to-lockdowns-harrier-safari-neon-altroz-tiago/2263036/,May 2021 car sales: Tata Motors registers 38% reduction in domestic sales due to lockdowns,"Pandemic-induced lockdown cause Tata Motors to show substantially reduced sales figures in May. The automaker saw a massive 40 per cent dip in passenger vehicles sales compared to previous month.

As the auto industry struggles with the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns, Tata Motors have shared their May 2021 sales figures. The figures show a continued downward trend as leading Indian automaker posted lower sales figures for yet another month. Tata Motors posted a domestic sales figure of 24,552 vehicles in the month of May, which is about 38 per cent less than the figure they achieved in April. These sales numbers include both passenger and commercial vehicles. If we take the export numbers into account, then the company managed to sell a total of 26,661 units.

Passenger vehicles (PVs) contributed towards a big chunk of the total domestic sales. The company sold 15,181 cars in May 2021, which is still a 40 per cent drop compared to the month before when the company sold 25,095 units. And let us remind you that the April sales were in turn lesser compared to the 29,654 vehicles sold in March 2021. Things are not much better on the commercial vehicle (CV) side either. While there was a rather small 8 per cent drop in the export figures for commercial vehicles, the domestic sales suffered a more significant 35 per cent drop. The only silver lining here is the massive Y-o-Y growth that is in the triple-digit range but that itself is not something huge to boast about since sales were at an all-time low last year when the pandemic had just begun. Around the same time, last year, Tata sold just 4,418 vehicles domestically out of which 3,152 vehicles sold belonged to the PV category and 1,266 to the CV category.

The second wave of Covid-19 hit the nation hard and resulted in lockdowns being imposed across states. Many companies even had to close operation temporarily amid the crisis. So, it is only natural that not many people are going out and buying vehicles at such a time when there are restrictions on travel. While many companies are making endeavours to make the car buying process as digital as possible, it will still take some time for the trend to catch on. Tata’s current product lineup includes vehicles like the Tiago, Togor, Altroz, Nexon, Harrier and Safari and customers can book and purchase any of the vehicles online. Things are rougher on the side of commercial vehicles. As many businesses have halted operations, demand for new products has reduced drastically too.",

TPG, California Public Employees’ Retirement System, Temasek, among others, have held conversations to lead or co-lead the financing exercise, sources told TOI.A Tata Motors spokesperson said the company was unable to offer any response regarding the fund-raise.In July, Tata Motors chairman N Chandrasekaran had told shareholders that the company would look to raise capital for the electric vehicle business and that it expects a quarter of sales to come from this business in the near future.In fiscal 2021, electric vehicle sales were just 2%. The investment would come into Tata Motors’ step-down electric vehicle arm, which plans to have at least 10 electric car models by 2025.Currently, Tata Motors has three electric car models, Nexon, Tigor and Xpres T sedan. It may also look to launch an electric SUV called Punch. Nexon is currently the top seller in India’s electric passenger vehicle market with sales of more than 7,000 units since its introduction in January 2020. In fact, Chandrasekaran too got himself a Nexon in August 2020.Tata Motors currently commands around 70% of the electric four-wheeler space. Tata Motors has been leveraging sister companies’ strengths — Tata Power (charging infrastructure), Tata Chemicals (battery cells), Tata Motors Finance (financing) and Croma (retail) — to boost its electric vehicle play.Tata Motors rival Ashok Leyland too had hived off its electric vehicle division into a separate entity, called Switch Mobility, which focuses on electric commercial vehicles in India and globally.In a Chennai International Centre organised virtual conference on Thursday, Mahesh Babu, CEO, Switch Mobility India, said legacy OEMs like Ashok Leyland are trying out the structure of having their electric business as a separate entity so that it is nimble like a startup but has the systems, processes and experience backup of the mother company as well.",

Tata Motors said the semiconductor shortage continues to impact the auto industry globally. ""The recent lockdowns in East Asia have worsened the supply situation and hence Tata Motors is forced to moderate production and offtake volumes in the coming months. The situation is fluid and we will continue to work to mitigate the impact of this and aim to meet our customer orders through an agile, multi-pronged approach including close engagement with our extended supply chain partners, procuring chipsets from the open market, using alternate chips and managing our model and trim mix.""

Tata Motors plans to drive in new models, expand its sales network as it aims to maintain its double-digit market share in the highly competitive domestic market. The auto major, which sells models including Nexon, Harrier and Safari, has clawed its way up to over 10 per cent market share in the passenger vehicle space in July this year after a span of nine years and now plans to hold on to it with a slew of measures.

Tata Motors had hiked the prices of its passenger vehicles by an average of 0.8 per cent from August 3. However, the company said it will offer protection from the price increase to vehicles of its 'New Forever' range that will be retailed on or before August 31.

These models are the first electric vehicles to receive the top rating under the Bharat New Car Assessment Program (BNCAP).

The rating certification was awarded to Tata Motors by minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari who also launched the BNCAP.

The BNCAP, launched in 2022 to enhance road safety and provide consumers with reliable information on vehicle safety, follows stringent testing protocols comparable to global standards.

The domestic, voluntary crash tests are aimed to encourage carmakers to produce safe and reliable electric vehicles for the Indian market.

The programme evaluates vehicles on multiple parameters, including adult occupant protection, child occupant protection, and safety assist technologies.

In the past two days, the stock has surged 20% on the NSE, touching a new 52-week high on Tuesday.

One reason for the optimism could be the buzz that the firm plans to enter into a partnership with Tesla. But reports have also said that a Tata Motors spokesperson has denied any such development.

The sharp appreciation in Tata Motors’ shares this week has meant that the stock has gained a whopping 264% from its 2020 lows seen on 3 April.

Catching up

There are some factors contributing to the optimism in the stock. On Monday, overseas subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) retail sales showed 13% growth in the December quarter versus the September quarter, although 9% lower year-on-year. Analysts reckon that the sequential recovery is encouraging and would ultimately support higher margins. Further, on Tuesday, Tata Motors said its global wholesales, including JLR, have risen 37% sequentially and are 1% higher year-on-year. According to analysts, these numbers are on expected lines and not particularly exciting.

Commenting on the stock performance, an analyst requesting anonymity said, “There is momentum in the stock now and the market is rewarding incremental good news generously.” As such, shares of Ashok Leyland Ltd, which is expected to benefit from better-than-anticipated recovery in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment, also hit a new 52-week high on Tuesday.

The improvement in Tata Motors’ business outlook has certainly helped. Basudeb Banerjee, auto analyst at Ambit Capital, said, “In the past 2-3 months, truck sales have been improving sequentially. Trucks are relatively a better margin business and improving volumes augur well for the margin outlook helped by cost-cutting initiatives. Eventually, this would support Tata Motors’ transition to becoming free cash flow positive on a standalone basis, from negative currently. Additionally, there is an expectation of positive announcements for the auto sector in the upcoming budget, after waiting for more than a year.”

Tata Motors is also on a deleveraging path. ICICI Direct Research said in a December report that Tata Motors “plans to reduce automotive debt to near zero levels in the next few years (about ₹48,000 crore as of FY20)”. It goes without saying that disappointments or delays on this front may come as a rude shock for investors.

Going ahead, covid-19-led lockdowns and its adverse impact on demand is a factor to watch out for, said analysts. Moreover, if there is a prolonged slowdown in the domestic market, it could hamper the recovery in sales and that’s a risk as well.",2021-01-12 13:56:39+05:30

In addition, the company also posted calendar year sales of 3,31,178 units (CY21), the highest ever since the inception of the PV Business. The overwhelming market response to Tata Punch launched in Oct '21 is further boosting demand for the company's ""New Forever"" range of cars and SUVs,"" added Chandra.While Hyundai Motor India was insulated for most of 2021 from the semiconductor shortage, the company was forced to correct production and even observe 'no production days' due to a shortage of parts over the last few months.Reviewing the December 2021 sales, Tarun Garg, director of sales and marketing at Hyundai Motor India, said that HMI had managed challenges to ensure smooth deliveries of their favourite Hyundai cars despite key component supply constraints its customers.""HMI has registered a healthy growth of 19.2 % in CY 2021 in the domestic market over last year's sales performance.

We will continue to work on a business agility plan and take proactive actions to mitigate these risks,"" cautioned Chandra.",

This was on the back of increasing demand for Nexon EV, which posted its highest-ever monthly sales of 650 units in June 2021,” he said.“The PV industry continues to witness uncertainty on account of global semiconductor shortage and rising commodity prices, while the demand side is on a progressive recovery path. We continue to see strong customer interest in our product offerings, resulting in a strong order book and we aim to fulfil those to the best of our abilities in this supply-constrained environment,” Chandra said.During the first quarter of the current fiscal year, Tata Motors recorded 64,386 unit sales in the passenger vehicle segment as against 14,571 units in the first quarter of the last fiscal year, thereby marking a growth of 342%.In the commercial vehicle segment, the auto major`s domestic sales went up 146% at 19,594 units in June 2021, as compared to 7,968 units in June 2020.In Q1 FY22, Tata Motors recorded total domestic CV sales at 43,400 units, 372% higher than 9,202 units registered in Q1 FY21.Girish Wagh, ED & president, commercial vehicles business unit, Tata Motors, said, “ The domestic sales of our commercial vehicles in Q1 FY22 at 43,400 units was ~56% lower than the previous quarter (Q4 FY21) as the momentum of strong sequential demand recovery, evident in the H2-FY21, was disrupted by the surge in COVID second wave. With decentralized restrictions and focus on micro containment zones this year, the sale in Q1 FY22 was 4.7 times of Q1 last year which was under complete lockdown.”“With demand across all segments impacted, we realigned our production to the revised retail visibility. The trucker and tipper sentiment indices saw a sharp drop, being comparable only with the level seen during complete lockdown last year. However, with easing restrictions and gradual reopening during the last fortnight of June 2021, we are witnessing increasing enquiries and retails,” he said.“International business continued the recovery momentum in Q1 FY22 and grew by 460% over Q1 FY21 as well as 24% over Q1 FY20.

The Indian automobile sector saw a major change in its retail landscape as the February 2025 report from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) revealed that Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors muscled their way to take second and third position respectively after Maruti Suzuki. This meant spelt bad news for Hyundai as it was pushed down from second to fourth place in the monthly retail ranking.

Battle for second spot

According to the FADA February 2025 report, Mahindra registered sales of 39,889 units with a market share of 13.15%, which is a major improvement YoY as it managed 11.74% in February 2024. Tata Motors recorded 38,696 units, a share of 12.75%. Hyundai lost major ground last month as it could muster 38,156 units with a 12.58% share. The South Korean company saw a massive drop in numbers from January’s 59,858 units to last month’s.

Mahindra has been working on an SUV offensive strategy since 2021 when it launched its flagship ICE vehicle, the XUV700, followed by the Scorpio N in 2022. The momentum continued in 2024 with the debut of the Thar Roxx and 3X0. In 2025, Mahindra made a bold move into the EV space, introducing two electric SUVs — the BE 6 and the XEV 9e.

Tata Motors has been on the front foot since the launch of the Punch in 2021. The micro-SUV was the best-selling vehicle in 2024 becoming the first non-Maruti Suzuki vehicle to achieve this feat in forty years. The Indian automobile manufacturer also had the first mover’s advantage by introducing a slew of affordable EVs including the Tiago EV, Tigor EV, Punch EV and the Nexon EV.

In a recent note, Avendus Spark noted that the company was heavily dependent on anchor clients, with revenue mix of more than 70 per cent in 2015. But it had consciously diversified the client portfolio, resulting in anchor clients’ mix reducing to 40 per cent in 9MFY23.

technologies to public sector institutions and private institutions/enterprises. As of December 2022, it had entered into agreements with four state governments, five private universities and over 150 private enterprises that use their proprietary iGetIT platform.

""We believe this business could provide an option value given the need to upskill a vast majority of engineers. Further, there is a possibility for it to scale up to a level, where it would be demerged as standalone business, similar to Corporate Learning segment that was demerged from NIIT Limited,"" Avendus Spark said.

On a 9MFY23 basis, the company has reported the overall relatively low revenue growth (majorly attributable to the de-growth in Education business), low margin expansion and higher attrition, B&K Securities said in a March note.

With already a head start, what will it mean for the brand and the industry? We take a look.

Tata Motors and TPG Rise Climate have entered into a binding agreement. TPG Rise Climate along with its co-investor ADQ is looking to invest in Tata Motors’ Passenger Electric Vehicle business. The subsidiary is said to become newly incorporated as well. TPG Rise Climate and co-investors shall acquire between 11 % to 15 % stake in the newly incorporated company with an investment of $1 billion (~Rs 7,500 crore). It would result in an evaluation of $9.1 billion (~Rs 68,900 crore).

Through the new investment, Tata Motors will channelise them into electric vehicles, develop battery electric vehicle platforms, advanced automotive technologies and catalyse investments in charging infrastructure and battery technologies.

Tata Motors is looking to create a strong portfolio consisting of 10 battery-electric passenger vehicles. While Tata Power will help create the infrastructure to support the anticipated rapid EV adoption in India.

N Chandrasekaran, Chairman Tata Motors Ltd commented, “I am delighted to have TPG Rise Climate join us in our journey to create a market-shaping electric passenger mobility business in India. We will continue to proactively invest in exciting products that delights customers while meticulously creating a synergistic ecosystem. We are excited and committed to play a leading role in the Government’s vision to have 30% electric vehicles penetration rate by 2030.”

Jim Coulter, Managing Partner TPG Rise Climate and Founding partner of TPG commented, “We are excited to partner with Tata Motors on their mission to lead the electrification of passenger mobility in India. There is significant momentum around India’s EV movement, supported by the Government’s vision and policies, as well as growing consumer demand for greener solutions. The investment aligns with TPG Rise Climate’s focus on decarbonised transport and builds on TPG’s long history in India.”

Tata Motors: The Dominator of EVs In the Future

The battery-electric passenger vehicle is still fairly a luxury good in the Indian market. Only a handful of models are available on sale. They include either high-end luxury models from Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Jaguar which cost over Rs 1 crore. On the other end of the spectrum, we have the Hyundai Kona Electric and the MG ZS EV, both of which sit in a premium position above the Rs 20 lakh range. Maruti Suzuki has been working on the development of an affordable electric vehicle for India, but it is yet to bring it to market.

As far as affordable electric cars go, Tata Motors is the only automaker to sell not one, but two models under the Rs 20 lakh barrier. The Tata Nexon EV and the recently introduced Tigor EV show that lithium-ion battery-powered vehicles can be available to the masses. Both of these models offer a heavy dose of localisation as well.

It is why, in a price-conscious market like India, Tata Motors has been dominating the electric vehicle space. In 2018, Tata Motors had just 11% market share in the EV space. With the new Ziptron platform that underpins the Nexon and Tigor EVs, Tata Motors has since captured the lion’s share. The Indian automaker currently holds 71% of the market share for electric vehicles in the country.

As we head towards the transition to electric vehicles, Tata Motors clearly has the upper hand by a huge margin over its competitors. With the injection of Rs 7,500 crore, supplemented by the knowledge it already has, Tata Motors could be invincible in the battle of EVs in the near to distant future.

The first round of capital infusion is said to be completed by March 2022. The entire funding would be disbursed by the end of next year.",

Auto major Tata Motors on Saturday reported a growth of 24% to 66,307 units in its domestic sales in December 2021. The company had sold 53,430 units in December 2020.In the passenger vehicle segment, the automaker witnessed 50% growth to 35,299 units in December 2021, as against 23,545 units in December 2020.Tata Motors sold 33,044 units of ICE cars and 2,255 units of electric cars in the month under review. Shailesh Chandra , president, passenger vehicles business unit, Tata Motors Ltd, said, “Decade high quarterly and monthly sales- 99,002 units in Q3 FY22 and 35,299 units in December 2021 were recorded. The company also posted calendar year sales of 3,31,178 units (CY21), highest ever since the inception of the PV Business.”Records were also created on the EV front as EV sales witnessed a new peak of 5,592 units in Q3 FY22. Consequently, EV penetration touched 5.6% of PV Sales during the quarter versus 1.8% in the same period last financial year. EV sales also touched 10,000 units in 9MFY22 and crossed 2,000 monthly sales landmark for the first time in December 2021 (2,255 units).The ever-increasing demand for Nexon EV and Tigor EV as well as progressive revival of the EV fleet segment were instrumental in driving this steep growth. Going forward, semiconductor supplies will remain the key source of uncertainty. Additionally, the impact of the new strain of Covid needs to be closely tracked. We will continue to work on the business agility plan and take proactive actions to mitigate these risks, he said.Tata Motors overtook Hyundai to become the second-largest seller of passenger vehicles in the domestic market for the first time in close to a decade in December 2021.In the commercial vehicle segment, its domestic sales stood at 31,008 units in December 2021, marking a growth of 4% as against 29,885 units in December 2020.Exports in the CV segment stood at 3,143 units as compared to 2,984 units in December last year, with a growth of 5%.Girish Wagh, executive director, Tata Motors Ltd, said, “The retail was ahead of wholesale by 15% in December 2021, enabling inventory alignment. The SCV and ILCV segments continued to benefit from the growth in e-commerce and the increasing need for last-mile delivery. Construction and infrastructure spending by central and state Governments plus rising activity in sectors such as mining, petroleum-oil-lubricants and allied industries facilitated the demand for M&HCVs. International business also continued its recovery momentum and grew by ~10% over the previous quarter (Q2 FY22) and 33% over the same quarter last year (Q3 FY21).”“Going forward, we expect the situation to remain fluid as the semiconductor shortage continues, instances of Covid begin to rise and underlying demand continues to remain under pressure. We are keeping a close watch on the evolving situation and sharpening our agile, multi-pronged approach to fulfill customer orders, he said.",

According to these numbers, Tata Motors has seen an 8.80 per cent growth in market share year-on-year from 34.99 per cent in November 2020 to 43.79 per cent in November this year. The auto behemoth reported commercial vehicle sales of 25,132 units in November 2021 versus 17,720 units in November 2020.

Tata Motors was followed closely by Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) logged commercial vehicle sales of 12,045 units in November versus 17,027 units in the same period last year. The Mumbai-based conglomerate had a market share of 20.99 percent in November.

“The CV segment continues to see traction in M&HCV segment. This aided by low base has resulted in double digit growth. The bus segment is still witnessing a dry run as educational institutes continue to remain closed. With diesel prices at record highs, supply of CNG vehicles are not able to meet the demand. Tight liquidity and unavailability of finance for customers who availed moratorium are also acting as sales barrier,” says FADA President Vinkesh Gulati.

Meanwhile, tractor sales have a different story to tell. Mahindra & Mahindra emerged as the leader of tractor sales during the same period with sales of 10,697 units in November 2021 versus 12,187 units in last year. M&M commanded a market share of 23.44 percent in tractor sales in November this year compared to 24.29 percent last year.

M&M’s Swaraj tractor division, on the other hand, sold 7,664 tractor units in November this year versus 8,695 last year. It saw a decline in its market share from 17.33 percent last year to 16.8 percent this year, as per the FADA numbers.

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/tata-motors-resurrects-in-uv-market-with-swift-new-launch-strategy/article38031782.ece,Tata Motors resurrects in UV market with ‘swift new launch strategy’,"Tata Motors is expected to end 2021 on a high note having resurrected itself in the Utility Vehicle (UV) segment. With new launches and a boom in the SUV market, the brand is set to secure the third position by volumes soon in the UV market. .

While the overall passenger vehicle (PV) industry witnessed a growth of 31 per cent during January-November period, the UV segment reported a whopping 62 per cent growth at 1.25 million units.

Tata Motors sold 1.52 lakh SUVs during January-November period, reporting an increase of 185 per cent vis-à-vis the same period last year.

Tata’s ‘New Forever’ range significantly improved the perception of Tata Motors’ brand over the last 18 months. The company has seen its NPS (net promoter score) grow from 25 in FY20 to 33 in Q3 FY22. (NPS is the difference between the percentage of promoters and detractors. For eg, in a brand survey targeting 100 people, if 60 promote the brand and 40 are its detractors, the NPS is +20).

“This has led to substantial improvement in consideration for Tata Motors cars and consequently an increase in overall sales. Therefore, the mix of SUVs in Tata Motors’ portfolio has increased from 37 per cent in CY20 to 52 per cent in CY21,” Shailesh Chandra, President Passenger Vehicles Business, Tata Motors, told BusinessLine .

In UVs, Tata Motors has one of the widest range of products consisting of sub-compact SUV (Punch), compact SUVs (Nexon, Nexon EV) and mid-size SUVs (Harrier and the New Safari), he added.

Full range

The Tata brand has a full range from entry-level Punch to Safari to address all price points in the UV segment. The novel design features and pleasing aesthetics in new models are being appreciated by the buyers. Also, its portfolio includes a higher number of vehicles with better safety ratings than competition. “Tata Motors’ growth in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment in recent years is driven by its niche presence with first-mover advantage, new launches, and great design language coupled with competitive prices. A lot of bells and whistles, new features, the latest powertrain, and good initial quality are also some of the key factors for Tata’s sales surge,” said Sanjeev Garg, Practice Leader-Automotive, Praxis Global Alliance.

The company’s marketing campaigns and reinvigorated dealer network have helped promote new models. Sharing of the platform has enabled the launch of multiple models from different segments under a single platform, thereby reducing the time spent in the development of new vehicles and production costs.

However, Tata Motors needs to speed up the launch of petrol engine variants of its popular SUVs, the Safari and Harrier. The gap is a true 4X4 SUV to compete with Mahindra Thar and Maruti Suzuki Jimny. But overall, good job by the carmaker to resurrect and address market needs swiftly, he added.

https://scroll.in/article/1084065/rivals-speed-ahead-as-tata-motors-lags-in-ev-race,Rivals speed ahead as Tata Motors lags in EV race,"This article was originally published in Rest of World, which covers technology’s impact outside the West.

Until recently, Tata Motors had a dream run in India’s electric-vehicle market.

The first homegrown automaker to successfully launch an EV in the country, it quickly gained traction with vehicles across diverse price points. By 2023, Tata Motors had cornered most of the Indian market.

Then came the speed bumps. Tata Motors’ fleet sales plummeted from 26,000 in 2023 to 2,000 in 2024. Its market share eroded from about 70% in early 2024 to 53% this year.

Rivals closed in. JSW MG Motor India, a joint venture between India’s JSW Group and China’s SAIC Motor, more than doubled its market share to 28% in 2025. It sold 3,765 EVs in May, while Tata Motors sold only 586 more, according to data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations. Domestic auto giant Mahindra & Mahindra sold 2,632 EVs and registered a 343% year-on-year growth.

Overall volumes continue to be small amid fluctuating demand in the Indian market. While the government aims for a third of all vehicles to be electric by 2030, EVs comprised only 2.5% of the 4.3 million cars sold in the country in 2024. Sales have grown to a modest 4% this year. The EV market is estimated to expand from $8 billion in 2023 to more than $117 billion by 2032.

Tata lost its first-mover advantage because of “innovative ways of selling by [JSW] MG”, Puneet Gupta, director for South Asia at automotive intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, told Rest of World. JSW MG’s competitive pricing and battery-as-a-service model – which allows customers to lease or subscribe to EV batteries – gave it an edge in the Indian market.

This signals a growing shift. As domestic and international electric carmakers try to win over India’s cost-conscious buyers, the battle ahead hinges on value, not just slashed rates.

Escalating price wars have triggered fears of a financial crisis in China’s EV sector. But in India, the still-nascent segment is following a different trajectory, industry experts told Rest of World. India’s increasingly well-traveled consumer prefers affordable EVs that can offer futuristic technology, good performance and reliability.

“It will not be a zero-sum game on pricing,” said Harshvardhan Sharma, a Gurugram-based auto tech and innovation expert at Nomura Research Institute. “Pricing is one of the factors – the competition is evolving around a value-based differentiation rather than a race to the bottom.”

Tata Motors aims to regain market leadership with a well-conceived product portfolio, new launches, and a renewed focus on improving after-sales service, according to its latest earnings report. Representatives from Tata and JSW MG did not respond to Rest of World’s requests for comment.

The rate of adoption is still slow, Rajat Mahajan, partner and auto sector leader for South Asia at global consulting firm Deloitte, told Rest of World. “And so, what is at play is: how can we get more customers aware of EVs, and get used to EVs.”

Tata Motors tackled the challenge early on. In 2020, it introduced the Nexon, an electric SUV priced at Rs 14 lakh, which became India’s most popular EV. In 2022, its most affordable hatchback, Tiago – which offered a range of 250 kilometers at a starting price of Rs 8.5 lakh – sold 10,000 units in one day.

But JSW MG chipped away at Tata Motors’ leadership with the Windsor – the country’s best-selling EV since its launch in September 2024. With an introductory price of Rs 13.5 lakh – only slightly higher than a premium hatchback – the spacious car is able to compete with the bigger SUVs and sedans in the market.

Much of Windsor’s success is tied to JSW MG’s introduction of the battery-as-a-service model in India, which gave the company a “significant tactical advantage,” Sharma said. “It allows the customer to decouple 50% of the acquisition cost of the product.” Such a service doesn’t just reduce upfront costs, it also encourages adoption by mitigating customer anxieties about vehicle range and battery health.

JSW MG has since extended the battery-as-a-service model to all its EV cars. These include the Comet – the company’s smallest EV – relaunched in March at a starting price of Rs 4.99 lakh ($5,800).

Tata Motors appears wary of battery-as-a-service for now. Its representatives argue the model is a “market activation storyline” that gives the illusion of better affordability without significantly lowering the total cost of ownership.

Earlier this month, Tata Motors launched its most advanced EV, the Harrier.ev, at an introductory price of Rs 21.49 lakh. Following JSW MG and Mahindra’s lead, it offered a lifetime warranty on the vehicle’s battery pack. The car is powered by a battery that is “designed and manufactured in India”, Anand Kulkarni, chief products officer for electric passenger vehicles at Tata Motors, said at the launch.

The company may still be able to regain its stronghold. As US protectionism disrupts global supply chains and forces Chinese automakers to turn to other markets, the Tata Group – Tata Motors’ parent company and one of India’s largest conglomerates – is pursuing a self-reliant ecosystem, dubbed the “Tata UniEVerse,” by leveraging diversified businesses.

Tata Power operates a vast infrastructure with over 5,500 charging points; outsourcing giant Tata Consultancy Services provides advanced research and product design for car technology; Tata Chemicals is engaged in cell development and localized manufacturing; and Tata Motors Finance extends financing solutions for customers and dealers.

Most EV companies tend to depend on Chinese batteries – Tata plans to change that. Its subsidiary Agratas is eyeing in-house production at a $1.5 billion plant in the western state of Gujarat, and a $5 billion battery gigafactory in the U.K.

“Nobody understands the EV industry in India today better than Tata,” Gupta said. “EV is about the ecosystem; it’s not only about car manufacturing.”

Tata Motors is also expanding overseas with its EVs in emerging economies such as Mauritius and Sri Lanka. It tasted initial success with its 2021 entry into Nepal, a fast-growing EV market, but Chinese brands have since gained ground.

In India, the competition is set to intensify as global players trickle in, albeit with uneven moves. As Tesla’s long-pending entry takes shape, it has shelved assembly plans and opted to roll out imported cars. VinFast India, a subsidiary of Vietnamese EV maker VinFast, was expected to debut with premium SUVs this month, but its launch plans have been delayed due to lagging production and dealers dropping out.

Although Chinese auto giant BYD has been operational in India for several years, the government has rebuffed its attempts to establish a local factory, citing national security concerns. Since BYD’s cars are imported, they’re more expensive than local competitors, limiting its market share.

Domestic EV upstarts, meanwhile, are experimenting with compact models. This January, Vayve Mobility, a Pune-based startup, launched Eva, a two-seater EV that goes into production next year – it is expected to be India’s cheapest electric car.

The car aims to address urban mobility challenges for nuclear families, and offers a range of 250 kilometres. Prices across models start from Rs 3.25 lakh ($3,700). It has a solar-panel roof for charging, in addition to a standard port.

The company plans to scale at a tempered pace and the car is currently sold out for the first year of production, Vilas Deshpande, co-founder and chief operating officer at Vayve Mobility, told Rest of World.

EV startups have had limited success in India so far, with four legacy carmakers dominating 80% of the market, according to research firm Bernstein.

Tata Motors Ltd aims to derive immense benefits from the demerger of the company into two units by focusing on expanding the passenger, commercial, and JLR businesses individually.

Currently, the mix is heavily tilted in the favour of the passenger business which brings in the bulk of the revenues for the Indian automaker.

During FY2022-23, Tata Motors’ PV, including JLR, accounted for 79 percent of the company's Rs 3,41,544 crore revenue while CVs contributed 21 percent.

The Tata Motors board on Monday approved the demerger of the company’s business into two separate units, Commercial Vehicles (CV) & its related investments under one entity and Passenger Vehicle (PV) businesses including PV, Electric Vehicles (EV), Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and its related investments in another entity.

“This move will empower both entities to pursue their respective strategies to deliver higher growth with greater agility while reinforcing accountability,” the company said in a statement.

Tata Motors said over the past few years the CV, PV, and JLR businesses have delivered a “strong performance” by successfully implementing “distinct strategies”. It also stated that since 2021 these businesses have been operating independently under their respective CEOs.Dissecting the segments

With all automotive verticals continuing their profitable growth trajectory, Tata Motors delivered a strong performance in Q3 FY24 at a consolidated level, with revenue of about Rs 1,10,600 crore (up 25.0 percent), EBITDA at about Rs 15,800 crore (up 60.6 percent) and net profit was about Rs 7,100 crore.

Its luxury car arm JLR also reported increased sales volumes for the third quarter of FY24 (three-month period to December 31, 2023), reflecting improvements in supply as more vehicles were delivered to clients. Revenue for the quarter was £7.4 billion, up 22 percent versus Q3 FY23 and up 8 percent versus Q2 FY24.

JLR’s wholesale volumes for the period stood at 101,043 units (excluding the Chery Jaguar Land Rover China JV), up 27 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago and up 4 percent compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Its Tata Motors brand of PVs, saw its volumes grow 5 percent YoY at 1,38,600 units supported by a strong supply situation, new SUV facelifts, and robust demand during the festive period.

The company, which launched a face-lifted version of Nexon (both ICE and EV), saw its PV revenues going up by 10.6 percent YoY at Rs 12,900 crore during Q3 FY24. The company claimed that its EV business EBITDA margins pre-R&D spending were near break-even.

In Q3 FY24, its domestic wholesale CV volumes were 91,900 units, marginally higher at 1.1 percent YoY. Exports stood at 4,800 units, up 14 percent YoY. Its revenues rose 19.2 percent to Rs 20,100 crore in Q3 on account of “salience towards medium and heavy commercial vehicles” and “better market operating price”.

During February, Tata Motors witnessed a 20 percent growth in PV sales at 51,267 units while CVs remained a drag on a high base. While the volumes of domestic PVs (including EVs) grew 19 percent YoY at 51,321 units, domestic EV sales grew 30 percent YoY at 6,923 units and contributed 13.5 percent to total PV sales versus 13 percent in January 2024.

Like the month before, July too proved to be a good time for carmakers. Almost all of the car manufacturers recorded healthy growth with respect to year-on-year performance. Maruti Suzuki sold 1,33,273 cars in July 2021. This was up by 36.78 per cent when compared to the July 2020 sales numbers of 97,768 units. It may be noted that during July 2020, the COVID wave was at its peak in India. Maruti’s sales were given a significant push due to its compact and sub-compact range of cars including the Swift, Dzire and Brezza. Hyundai India in the meanwhile sent 48,042 cars to new homes in July 2021. This, when compared to July 2020, represents a 25.8 per cent growth. For Hyundai, the sales drivers have been the new Creta, and Grand i10 range, along with the i20. Tata Motors was in third position but recorded a huge 101 per cent gain when compared to last year. 30,185 cars were sold in July 2021 whereas 15,012 were sold last year.

Another manufacturer that managed to record a near 101 per cent growth vis-a-vis last year was MG India. The British carmaker 4,225 cars in July 2021. It also claimed that the highest number of ZS EVs were sold – 404. Toyota managed to move more than 13,105 cars in July this year whereas in 2020, it managed to dispatch 5,386 units. Players like Skoda that are aiming for a chunk of the market share seem to have hit the nail on the head with their recent launches. The Skoda Kushaq helped the Czech brand to sell 3,080 cars in July 2021 while only 922 cars were sold in July 2020. It is highly likely that next month, we will see a higher number of Kushaqs being delivered and thereby Skoda’s share will increase exponentially. However, whether it is a new car craze or genuine sustained interest is a point we need to wait and watch.

Nissan India managed to sell 4,259 cars in July 2021. This corresponds to a 443 per cent growth rate when compared to last year. The obvious benevolence here is from the Nissan Magnite, a compact SUV that has helped the brand grow.",

For the past few years now, Tata Motors has made a habit of winning. After a decade of trouble, when its vehicles had lost touch with personal car buyers, the automaker has scripted a remarkable turnaround, building models that have taken the Indian automobile market by storm.

Today, the automaker corners some 10 percent of the passenger vehicle market, almost twice the share it held five years ago. The turnaround also comes at a time when the automobile industry had seen a tumultuous period, hit hard by the pandemic, paving way for further inroads as sales in the sector return to normalcy.

In the process, the company’s market capitalisation has nearly quadrupled in the past year making it one of India’s most valuable automakers currently.

Yet, despite all the recent success, Tata Motors hasn’t been resting on its laurels. The company is currently in the midst of laying the foundations for what it reckons will be a revolution underway in the Indian automobile sector in the coming years.

Today, Tata Motors is India’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, cornering some 75 percent of the market, led by its hugely popular Nexon EV which currently receives some 3,500 order a month. That’s also perhaps why it came as no surprise when in September, a subsidiary being set up by the company became India’s most valuable EV company, after raising $1 billion from private equity major TPG Rise Climate. The deal values the yet-to-be operational subsidiary at over $9 billion and the capital infusion is expected around March next year. Tata Motors will also invest $2 billion into the subsidiary over the next five years. Not just that, the group is also busy building what it calls Tata UniEVerse, an ecosystem that will leverage group synergies, where several Tata companies will together to provide EV solutions to consumers as it looks to improve adoption in the country. The big gamble with electric vehicles also comes at a time when at least six major automakers including the likes of Ford, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, and Volvo, and 31 national governments pledged at the recently concluded COP26, to phase out sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040 worldwide, and by 2035 in leading markets. “This is a big opportunity to lead the charge in this space (EV) and go about creating 10 products, and also create the ecosystem around it so that the aspiration of driving growth in electrification does not suffer because of lack of ecosystem,” Shailesh Chandra, president of Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle segment, tells Forbes India.

Last year, the domestic auto industry was grappling with tough times due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s second wave wreaking havoc on the workforce, carmakers and also on the supply chain. The low buying sentiment among consumers and production disruptions were the main reason behind the low sales.

However, now when the economy seems to be recovering and with production seemingly back on track, several carmakers are reporting year-on-year as well as month-on-month sales growth.

Maruti Suzuki

India’s largest car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki India announced that it had sold 161,413 cars in May 2022. Total sales in the month include domestic sales of 128,000 units, sales to other original equipment manufacturers (OEM) of 6,222 units and its highest ever monthly exports of 27,191 units.

Maruti Suzuki, in a regulatory filing, also revealed that sales of its mini cars — Alto and S-Presso— stood at 17,408 units in May 2022 as against 4,760 in the same month last year.

The company said sales in the compact segment — which includes Swift, Celerio, Ignis, Baleno and Dzire — were at 67,947 units in May this year, as against 20,343 in May 2021.

Maruti Suzuki also stated that the shortage of electronic components had a minor impact on the production of its vehicles, mainly on domestic models. The company had also taken all possible measures to minimise the impact, it added.

The sales figures for May 2022 are not comparable with that of May 2021 as the operations in May 2021 were significantly affected due to COVID-19 related disruptions, the company added.

Kia

Kia India sold 18,718 units in May 2022, comfortably registering a year-to-date (YTD) increase of 19 per cent. However, the overall sales of the company decreased in comparison to its sales in April 2022, which stood at 19,019 units, respectively.

If there is a phoenix in the Indian automobile market, it is undoubtedly Tata Motors. Once written off by large multitudes of India’s car buyers, after it struggled with product refreshments and its perception as a fleet taxi operator, the Mumbai-headquartered automaker has scripted a fairytale turnaround in the past few years. Today, it is India’s third-largest carmaker, cornering 10 percent of the market share, up from a paltry 4.8 percent in 2020.

The stellar turnaround in sales has meant that the market capitalisation of the automaker, which also owns the iconic Jaguar Land Rover, has nearly quadrupled in the past year, even as India’s automobile industry grappled with an economic slowdown and lockdowns over the past 18 months. As of October, Tata Motors had a market capitalisation of Rs 1.62 lakh crore, up from Rs 43,800 crore last October. During the same period, the Sensex, the benchmark index of the BSE, grew by nearly 50 percent from 39,749.85 points to 59,252 points.

And there seems to be no stopping the Tata Motors juggernaut. Between July and September, sales of the 76-year-old automaker grew by a staggering 50 percent, led largely by a 193 percent growth in the company’s electric vehicle (EV) portfolio, comprising the popular Nexon EV and Tata Tigor EV. During that time, Tata Motors sold 2,700 units of its EVs, compared to some 900 units in the year ago period.

Those numbers mean that the company controls as much as 75 percent of the domestic EV market in India, especially since other manufacturers are yet to jump on to the electric vehicle bandwagon. Barring Hyundai, which offers the Hyundai Kona, several manufacturers, including India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, and Toyota are yet to make EV offerings in India even as 10,000 electric vehicles manufactured by Tata Motors ply the Indian roads.

That’s also perhaps why it came as no surprise when over the past month, a subsidiary being set up by the company became India’s most valuable EV company, after raising $1 billion from private equity major TPG Rise Climate. The deal values the yet-to-be operational subsidiary at over $9 billion and the capital infusion is expected around March next year. Tata Motors will also invest $2 billion into the subsidiary over the next five years.

The new company, Tata Motors believes, will leverage all the existing investments and capabilities of the parent company in addition to channelising all the future investments into electric vehicles and dedicated battery vehicle platforms and technologies, among others. Over the next five years, the company will also create a portfolio of 10 EVs while also partnering with Tata Power to create charging infrastructure to help with early adoption.

“This is a big opportunity to lead the charge in this space (EV) and go about creating 10 products, and also create the ecosystem around it so that the aspiration of driving growth in electrification does not suffer because of lack of ecosystem,” Shailesh Chandra, president of Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle segment, tells Forbes India. Chandra, who took over as president of the passenger vehicle business in 2020, had earlier been the head of the EV division, and has been instrumental in turning around the automaker’s fortunes over the past few years.

A large part of the turnaround, of course, is largely on the back of the increased sales of four vehicles that have now become the mainstay of the carmaker. Together, they form part of what Tata Motors calls the ‘New Forever’ range of vehicles, which boast high safety standards, better engine performance, and driving pleasure, aesthetic design, and rich features, in comparison to some of their previous models.

“Our focus over the past 18 months has been to ensure that we are able to get the rightful volumes for the products that we have created and everything else is consequential,” Chandra adds. That means, from monthly sales of some 5,000 units of its Tata Nexon and 700 units of Tata Harrier a few years ago, sales have jumped almost three times in some cases over the last year.

“Tata is a leading player in the EV business with more than 70 percent market share and at the forefront of indigenous EV efforts while expecting green vehicles to generate 20 percent of their total sales in the next four to five years,” Harshvardhan Sharma, head of auto retail practice at Nomura Research Institute Consulting, says. “In that capacity, this seems like a prudent vision to create a subsidiary which is insulated from conventional business operations for structural and operational efficiency reasons. As this subsidiary will be asset-light and as we understand the investments will align towards creating intellectual properties such as new vehicle designs and platforms in the EV space, this makes it a good fit from a business autonomy, flexibility, and pace of operations perspective.”

The big leap

Much of the group’s foray into the EV business began in 2017.

That year, Tata was selected as a winner by the government-owned Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) to sell some 10,000 EVs to the government. Tata Motors bid Rs 10.16 lakh per vehicle for 500 cars in the first phase of the government’s electric mobility mission. “At Tata Motors, we keep working on technologies and are quite ahead when a technology can be commercialised,” says Chandra. “Therefore, we had been working on electric vehicles primarily at the Tata Motors European Technical Center from the early parts of the last decade.”

The early part of the last decade saw the then-Manmohan Singh government announce the National Electric Mobility Mission which had aimed to transform the country’s EV penetration. That was followed by the highly popular FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV) scheme to incentivise the production and promotion of EVs. Currently in its second phase—which runs until March 2022—it has an outlay of Rs 10,000 crore. The scheme is extended to cover electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and buses among others.

“In 2015, FAME was introduced for the first time. But the outlay was very small,” Chandra says. “And still the direction was not clear whether it would be the pure battery-electric vehicle route or whether it would be hybrid. All those debates were on at that point in time.”

By 2016, with the global trend moving towards reducing carbon emissions, and countries attempting to follow the Paris Climate accord, the global automobile industry had also begun tilting towards a battery-led EV play. India is a signatory to the Paris Climate Agreement, which means that the country needs to reduce its carbon emissions by around 35 percent of its 2005 levels by 2030.

“Unlike many countries, there was a bigger national imperative for the country given that we had 14 out of the 15 most polluted cities in the world,” Chandra says. “And our dependence on imports of oil is very high. There is also an energy security issue from a geopolitical perspective which was also pushing the government.” At that time, India was also in the midst of a transition to more stringent norms on emissions, which had meant that automakers were investing a significant amount of money in the transition.

“We knew that the technology shift was imminent towards electric,” Chandra says. “It was going to come in a matter of five to six years.”

It was around that time that the company also won the rights to sell vehicles to EESL. “The EESL order provided an anchor opportunity,” Chandra says. “In the journey of electrification, it taught us how important it was to gain real-world experience, putting them in real use and the challenges of the working environment.” As Tata’s vehicles began plying the roads, it also gave the company a fair understanding of the real-world conditions for an electric vehicle.

“It was clear that you have to enter the segment in a big way. And the personal segment is important because this is 90-95 percent of the total industry volumes,” Chandra says. “Making a product is not sufficient. You have to really shape the electrification and go for an ecosystem approach.” In April 2019, the government announced the launch of the second phase of FAME policy, which would encourage faster adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles by way of offering upfront incentives on the purchase of EVs. “That further refined our thinking in terms of the nature of products that we want to bring, and the price points. And there was the clarity of the localisation approach.” (The government wants companies to localise their components to qualify for benefits.)

The big push

The company’s first offering in the private vehicle segment was the Tata Tigor EV, with a range of 213 kilometres on a single charge at a price of Rs 9.44 lakh. The older version of Tigor EV had a range of 142 kilometres but was largely sold only to EESL. The car came equipped with a 21.5 kWh battery pack and two charging ports for fast charging as well as slow charging.

By 2020, however, Tata was ready with a coup of sorts. The company unleashed the electric variant of the wildly popular Tata Nexon, priced at around Rs 13.99 lakh and with a range of 312 kilometres. The Nexon was one of the company’s highest-selling models, and the EV provided an opportunity to test the market. The Nexon, which was launched in 2017, was envisaged as a bridge vehicle as the company undertook a restructuring of its product platforms. Platforms are design architectures that include the underfloor, engine compartment, and frame of a vehicle.

“We did a survey, and it came out that the minimum range that a customer is looking for to avoid range anxiety is 200 kilometres,” Chandra says. “That means a certified range has to go above 300 kilometres or so. At the same time, the customer is not willing to give more than 25 percent premium.” That meant that the company’s best bet was the Nexon, which was retailing between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 12 lakh. “If you have to give a 300-kilometre battery pack in a Tiago, the cost will be the same, but the premium will be high.”

In September this year, the company announced that it had sold 10,000 EVs in the country. “The extent of bookings that we are getting is between 3,500 and 4,000,” Chandra says. “Last year, we had been ramping up supplies. At the start of this financial year, we were supplying around 600 vehicles which grew to 1,000 and then 1,100. We are now approaching closer to 1,500 supplies per month.” In addition, the company has also launched the XPRES T electric sedan, an exclusive vehicle option for fleet customers. “We have a 100 percent market share there,” adds Chandra.

“India’s EV revolution ideally should have been led by Maruti Suzuki as it’s the largest player,” says Puneet Gupta, director for automotive forecasting at market research firm IHS Markit. “Instead, it is Tata Motors which is leading the revolution and is likely to be followed by Mahindra. Globally there is a paradigm shift underway when it comes to decarbonising the mobility sector and the Tatas clearly have a first-mover advantage. The ongoing pandemic has changed people’s mindset and that means Tata’s first-mover advantage will pay off.”

Then, as part of its plan to bring in wider adoption, the group has built Tata UniEVerse, an ecosystem that will leverage group synergies, where several Tata companies have come together to provide EV solutions to consumers. The company has partnered with Tata Power to provide end-to-end charging solutions at home, the workplace, and public charging facilities. Under this partnership, the company has installed fast-charging stations in metros, including Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, in addition to chargers on highways. So far, Tata Power has set up 1,000 EV charging stations across India in some 180 cities.

The company has also tied up with Tata Chemicals in its attempt to build a component supplier ecosystem and manufacture lithium-ion battery cells, in addition to looking at active chemical manufacturing and battery recycling.

“The current technology and range specs are quite evolved frankly,” Sharma of Nomura says. “We must keep in mind that these products have undergone much evolution since the introduction and Tata has been listening patiently to market feedback and hence the technology is fairly acceptable. Regarding range, there’s always going to be a difference between test conditions and real-world usage owing to climate, driving patterns, and terrains, but frankly, anything beyond 200 kilometres is good enough in the current scenario pragmatically.”

A rounded play

Yet, it’s not that the company is entirely pivoting to EVs as many global manufacturers have announced.

Over the past few months, everyone from General Motors to Ford Motor Company, Volkswagen and Honda have been making commitments to shift their entire fleet to electric vehicles, over the next few decades. General Motors now plans to sell only those vehicles that have zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, while Japanese automaker Honda made it clear that the company intends to only sell EVs and fuel cell vehicles by 2040. In Europe, American automaker Ford said it will only be offering electric cars from 2030.

By 2025, Volkswagen wants to build and sell up to 3 million all-electric cars per year with over 50 purely electric-powered variants. All this follows the massive success story of Tesla, which has gone on to join the coveted trillion-dollar club after the company announced a plan to sell 100,000 vehicles to Hertz, indicating a massive shift underway from a demand perspective too.

“The Indian market story might be slightly different,” Chandra says. “Today, the Indian passenger vehicle market would be 3.5 million units a year. If you fast forward to 2030, this will grow by double to nearly seven million. If you take a 30 percent penetration, it would mean two million EVs. There is an opportunity on the EV side to grow from zero to two million.” The rest of the seven million, Chandra reckons, will be ICE vehicles. “So, there is a growth opportunity in both these spaces,” Chandra says. “ICE vehicles will become more emission friendly.”

That’s why the company is looking to launch as many as 10 new products over the next decade. That includes first-generation vehicles, which are essentially ICE vehicles that will be converted to electric vehicles. That will be followed by architectures that will be suited for EV and ICE vehicles and eventually born EVs. Much of the work will be undertaken at the company’s EV facility in Pune and Chandra and the team are currently in the midst of setting up the subsidiary. The automaker is also lining up a $2 billion investment towards product development while also planning to launch sales in over 100 cities and some 255 touchpoints through the year.

“Our teams will be separate, and that’s the reason why you’re seeing us creating two different companies,” Chandra says. “One will fund itself and be able to support its growth and investment in new technologies, platform, and product lifecycle management. The other requires a massive investment phase which is why we went for separate funding.” As of now, the company has a 60 percent localisation of its components, which it wants to ramp up to 85 percent by 2025.

Meanwhile, it’s not just passenger vehicles that Tata Motors is betting on to drive the change.

The commercial vehicle division, which comprises buses, trucks and light commercial vehicles, is also beginning to witness higher electrification. So far, Tata Motors has supplied a total of 618 e-buses that have run approximately 20 million kilometres to date.

“The number of vehicles we have been selling would have been higher if not for Covid-19,” says Girish Wagh, head of commercial vehicles at Tata Motors. “There has been a collapse in the bus market. But, with the cost of vehicles increasing with every emission regulation and rising fuel prices, the total cost of ownership parity is becoming closer and closer when it comes to electric vehicles.”

That means even though sales are now largely led by government orders, the company reckons that private buyers, especially corporates and ecommerce companies, could lead the charge when it comes to the adoption of EVs. “Corporates have their own net-zero targets,” adds Wagh. “Ecommerce companies, which are focusing on last-mile connectivity, are also seeing benefits in operating costs.” At the moment, Tata’s electric buses have a range of over 100 kilometres which it plans to ramp up to between 140 kilometres and 200 kilometres.

Then, there is also the focus on alternative fuels, such as hydrogen fuel cells, which Wagh reckons is crucial when it comes to long-range travel. “Battery electric vehicles are generally suitable for the lower range and lower power,” Wagh says. “But when you start looking at commercial vehicles and the medium-heavy commercial vehicles, they generally travel 1,000 kilometres a day. They also carry 10 tonnes to 15 tonnes of load. So, it’s a completely different kind of transportation and there, battery-electric doesn’t work, and that’s where we work with hydrogen.”

The path ahead

It helps that the global automobile ecosystem is now shifting towards EVs. Then, over the past few years, India has seen a significant rise in fuel prices. India’s import of crude oil required for vehicular fuel has been increasing over the years. It stood at $40 billion in 2017 and is projected to more than double to $90 billion by 2030 at the current pace. At the same time, battery cost has reduced from $800 per kilowatt-hour in 2011 to $137 per kilowatt-hour in 2020.

According to Niti Aayog, the country’s EV financing industry is projected to be worth Rs 3.7 lakh crore in 2030, about 80 percent of the current retail vehicle finance industry.

Between 2020 and 2030, the estimated cumulative capital cost of the country’s EV transition will be Rs 19.7 lakh crore across vehicles, electric vehicle supply equipment, and batteries (including replacements).

“Tata’s commitment to EV cements the belief in electric power trains being a near future in India and not being an exotic propulsion system for developed markets only,” says Sharma of Nomura. “The market has surely taken notice of this shift and both OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and consumers respect and appreciate this development. Tata is leading the electric mobility chapter in India from the front, and we see its payoff panning out well for Tata as they are co-developing the ecosystem and hence addressing a much wider part of the value chain.”

“There is a broad scenario of how the whole penetration will move and therefore we have set certain aspirational targets,” Chandra says. “We are working towards that and the network planning and charging infrastructure planning is being aligned to that. This kind of an opportunity will attract people and some of them will take a proactive approach like us and some would just like to wait and watch.”

Despite all the narrative around EVs, there haven’t been substantial gains. Last year, India sold some 156,000 units of EVs, of which 126,000 were two-wheelers. In contrast, over 21 million vehicles that run on internal combustion engines were sold in FY20, of which 17 million were two-wheelers. China sold some 1.3 million EVs in 2020, according to Singapore-based market research firm Canalys, in a year marked by a pandemic, accounting for over 40 percent of the global EV sales. “This is an industry where word of mouth is crucial,” adds Chandra.

All that means Tata Motors has a long way to go, and it’s only getting started after its phenomenal turnaround in fortunes.

“I see the future of electric vehicles to be very strong,” Chandra says. “EVs have better running cost and better performance. The only concern is about technology.” To alleviate that, the group has been offering an eight-year warranty on the vehicle. “Our competitive advantage is that I’m working in a synchronised fashion with Tata Power, and we are therefore working closely with them in terms of aligning the location of the charging units to where we are selling the cars.”

Meanwhile, the company is also aware of the challenges that the global electric ecosystem can throw up. “There will be a lag on the supply side versus demand ramp-up which will happen, and the battery would be one of the key components because today I would imagine that the global capacity of batteries would be 250-gigawatt hours. Fast forward 10 years from now, the requirement might be 2,500 gigabytes,” Chandra says. “Therefore, there can be stress going forward, but at the same time, there are entrepreneurs across the world who would like to ride this wave, so they would also be proactively thinking about it.”

So, will the first-mover advantage really work? “While they have a first-mover advantage, the combined Kia-Hyundai entity could be a challenge in the future,” adds Gupta of IHS Markit. “The Koreans have a significant advantage when it comes to the battery supply ecosystem. But so far, their focus has been on the Rs 15 lakh to Rs 25 lakh market. Others like the Japanese will push until the last minute to stay away from the transformation but it is inevitable. That means, as the first mover, Tata has a massive opportunity, and a challenge in front of them.”

Who better than the Tatas to turn a challenge into an opportunity.",

Aside from new launches, the carmaker is set to introduce additional options for its current lineup. Here’s more about what’s expected:

Gravitas

After making its debut as a near-production model at Auto Expo 2020 and a lengthy delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tata Motors is now all set to introduce the Harrier-based Gravitas SUV in India. It is 63mm longer and 80mm taller than the Harrier and gets a stepped roof and upright tail gate to accommodate the third row. Expect features to remain relatively unchanged. It could retain the 170PS/350Nm 2.0-litre diesel engine, with a 1.5-litre turbo-petrol likely to join the lineup later. The production-spec Gravitas will debut at the end of January with a launch around early February. It is likely to garner a premium of around Rs 1 lakh over the Harrier that retails from Rs 13.84 lakh to Rs 20.30 lakh (ex-showroom). Once launched, it’ll go up against the MG Hector Plus and the upcoming next-gen Mahindra XUV500.







Altroz Turbo

Tata Motors’ first 2021 launch will be the turbocharged iteration of the Altroz premium hatchback on January 13. It will utilise a 110PS/140Nm 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine and could be the first Tata to offer a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission option alongside the 5-speed manual gearbox. It is likely to retain from Rs 8 lakh onwards (ex-showroom) and rival the likes of the Volkswagen Polo TSI and the Hyundai i20 Turbo.

HBX

Another model that made its debut in concept form at Auto Expo 2020, the production-spec HBX micro-SUV has been spotted testing multiple times in India. Highlights include an SUV-esque upright stance, split headlamps with slots for LED DRLs running along the bonnet, and split-four-spoke dual-tone alloy wheels (possibly 16-inches). Expect a similar cabin to the concept with bits like a floating touchscreen infotainment system, Harman sound system, and a multi-function steering wheel. It could be powered by the Altroz’s 86PS/113Nm 1.2-litre, naturally aspirated petrol engine with an electric powertrain on the cards. Expect a name reveal and launch around early 2021 with prices likely to start from Rs 5.5 lakh (ex-showroom). It could rival the Maruti Suzuki Ignis and Mahindra KUV100 NXT.

Altroz EV

Next up is the all-electric iteration of the Altroz that made its debut in concept form at Auto Expo 2020. The main difference aside from a tweaked front end and different wheels is that it’ll be powered by Tata’s Ziptron powertrain that delivers a driving range of 300km on a single charge in the Nexon EV. It could be launched in the second half of2021 with prices likely to start from Rs 12 lakh (ex-showroom).

Hexa BS6

2021 could also see the return of the Hexa with a necessary BS6 upgrade as it has been spied testing in the country. It will be powered by a BS6-compliant 2.2-litre diesel engine with 6-speed manual and automatic transmission options as well as rear-wheel drive and 4x4 options. What’s more is that spied test mules hint at a 4x4 AT variant potentially in the works. Expect a price increment of around Rs 50,000 over the now discontinued BS4 model (Rs 13.25 lakh onwards, ex-showroom). It will go up against the likes of the Toyota Innova Crysta and the MG Hector Plus.

Nexon DCT

The Altroz Turbo is likely to become the first Tata model to get a 7-speed DCT automatic transmission, and the Nexon sub-4 metre SUV could soon become the second. That’s because it utilises the same 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine as the Altroz. It is currently offered with a 6-speed AMT alongside the 6-speed manual gearbox options. The Nexon could get the 7-speed DCT option a few months after the Altroz gets it on January 13. This gearbox is likely to be exclusive to the higher end variants. Expect prices to be at a premium over the AMT variants that currently retail from Rs 8.44 lakh (ex-showroom).",

The Indian carmaker has posted its best monthly sales of all time in January 2022. Though having come up just shy of Hyundai this month, 40,777 units is the most vehicles Tata Motors has ever sold in a single month, and the brand is confident of crossing the 50,000 mark sometime this year.

Moreover, the brand’s plants set their own records for production, with the Pune facility recording its highest production since 2007, and the Ranjangaon facility its highest production ever.

Tata sold 28,108 SUVs in January 2022, its highest ever

EV sales of 2,892 units helps cement market leader position

Newly launched CNG models sold 3,000 units in a month

Tata Motors SUVs lead the way, EV dominance continues

The big hitters in Tata’s resurgence have, of course, been its SUV models, which accounted for 28,108 units last month. Joining the bestselling Nexon compact SUV is the recently launched Punch sub-compact SUV, with both models having crossed 10,000 units apiece in January. What this also tells us is, despite their premium positioning, the higher-priced Harrier and Safari still managed to put in a respectable combined performance of close to 8,000 units.

With just a single model – the Nexon EV – for most of 2021, Tata Motors managed to become the market leader for EVs in India, accounting for a meaty and enviable 70 percent of all electric cars sold. This was bolstered by the Tigor EV towards the rest of the year and, riding on this success, the brand was able to sell the most EVs in a month ever, at 2,892 units, in January 2022. The contributing factors, of course, are an early-mover advantage and the fact that these are the two most affordable passenger EVs on sale right now. This, however, is only the beginning for Tata Motors, which has an aggressive 10-EV plan in store for the next five years.

Tata Tiago, Tigor CNG make strong debut

Launched just last month, Tata Motors’ two CNG offerings, the Tiago iCNG and Tigor iCNG, already seem to have found popularity amongst the Indian car-buying public. In the month of their introduction alone, they managed to account for 42 percent of all Tiago and Tigor model sales. Combined, both CNG models sold over 3,000 units, and as we found out in our review of the Tiago CNG, it’s not just because they, unlike most CNG cars, retain the strong driving characteristics of their petrol counterparts. It is also because, unlike rivals, they are offered in a number of different variants and price points, not just a single low-spec model, which gives them a broader appeal.

Tata Motors’ winning streak shows no sign of abating, and with a range of popular models and the promise of an exciting electric future, expect to see it feature near the top of the sales charts for more months to come.

Do you think Tata Motors will regain and retain the number-two carmaker spot in 2022? Let us know in the comments section below.",

Will the Nifty auto stock rebound anytime soon?","Tata Motors' stock has faced a significant downturn, declining over 47 per cent from its July 2024 peak of ₹1,179 to ₹621.10, as of March 3, 2025. The stock has endured a consistent downtrend over the last seven months, erasing over ₹2 lakh crore in market capitalisation. The decline is attributed to a weaker demand outlook for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), challenges in the domestic passenger vehicle (PV) segment, and broader macroeconomic concerns.

Prolonged Losing Streak and Market Performance Tata Motors was among the top-performing stocks in 2023, doubling in value and leading gains on the Nifty 50 index. However, its fortunes have reversed, making February the seventh consecutive month of decline. The over 13 per cent drop in February also marks its worst monthly performance since October 2024, when the stock declined by 14.4 per cent. This downturn represents the company's longest losing streak since 2015, when the stock fell for seven months before rebounding.

Meanwhile, in the last one year, it has shed over 37 per cent. The auto stock also hit its 5 2-week low of ₹606.20 in the previous session, March 3, 2025.

In the long term, over five years, the auto stock has soared 390 per cent.

Sales and Financial Performance Impacting Sentiment The slump in Tata Motors' stock aligns with a weakening financial performance. The company's domestic sales fell 9 per cent year-on-year (YoY) in February, dropping to 46,435 units from 51,267 units in the same period last year. The electric vehicle (EV) segment witnessed a steeper decline of 23 percent YoY, reflecting competitive pressures and slowing demand in the segment.

In Q3 FY25, the company reported a 22 per cent YoY decline in net profit to ₹5,451 crore, impacted by lower margins and a slowdown in its JLR division. While revenue increased by 3 per cent YoY to ₹1.13 lakh crore, consolidated EBITDA came in at ₹15,500 crore, down 16 per cent YoY and 19 per cent below analysts' expectations.

Brokerages Turn Cautious on Tata Motors Global brokerage Jefferies downgraded Tata Motors from ""buy"" to ""underperform,"" slashing its price target to ₹660 from ₹930. The firm cited weak demand in China and Europe, rising customer acquisition costs, and higher warranty expenses at JLR. It also noted increasing competition in the EV market and a slowing demand trend in India’s commercial and passenger vehicle segments. Jefferies revised its FY25-27 EBITDA and EPS estimates downward by 7-11 percent and 5-10 percent, respectively.

Similarly, Nuvama Institutional Equities reduced its target price to ₹720 from ₹750 while maintaining a 'reduce' rating. The firm expects muted revenue and EBITDA growth over FY25-27, citing order book exhaustion at JLR, discontinuation of Jaguar models, and subdued demand across key regions. Nuvama also anticipates a weak performance in the commercial vehicle (CV) segment due to moderate road construction spending and a high base effect.

Technical Analysis: Signs of Stability at Key Support Levels Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, noted that Tata Motors has seen a sharp correction since its peak. However, a Doji candlestick formation at the ₹600–620 support zone signals potential stability. This support coincides with a rising trendline, suggesting the possibility of a reversal in the near term.

Despite trading below key moving averages, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates oversold conditions, hinting at a short-term recovery. Options data for the March series highlights ₹600 as a strong support level, while ₹700 serves as a key resistance.

What Lies Ahead for Tata Motors? In summary, while Tata Motors has faced a prolonged correction, its long-term returns remain strong. However, near-term challenges persist, including weak demand in China and Europe, rising costs, and intensified competition in the EV market.

Investors may see the ₹600–620 range as a potential entry point, but caution is warranted due to ongoing macroeconomic and sector-specific risks. The company's Q4 performance will be critical in determining whether Tata Motors can stabilize and regain investor confidence.

According to a report by Reuters, citing Economic Times, the automaker has begun to talk with sovereign wealth funds and private equity investors to raise funds via stake sale.

The funds and investors include the UAE-based Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and Mubadala Investment Company, the Saudi Arabia-headquartered Public Investment Fund, Singapore's Temasek Holdings, and KKR and General Atlantic.

The daily claimed that Tata Motors might sell a significant minority stake, eyeing a valuation of about $10.5 billion.

Mint couldn't independently verify the report.

In 2021, Tata Motors raised $1 billion from TPG and Abu Dhabi state holding company ADQ for its EV unit at a $9 billion valuation, pledging to invest more than $2 billion in its EV business over five years.

This week, the Mumbai-based auto major signed an MoU with ridesharing app Uber to bring 25,000 XPRES-T EVs into their premium category service.

Aligned towards its goal of a clean and green environment, Tata Motors will be aiding Uber in electrifying its services across Delhi-National Capital Region, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Ahmedabad. The company will begin the deliveries of the cars to Uber fleet partners in a phased manner, starting this month.

Tata XPRES-T EV, a budget electric sedan car, was launched in 2021 in India.

Tata Motors said it is leading the e-mobility wave in India with over 50,000 Tata EVs rolled out from the plant to date in the personal and fleet segment.

In July 2021, Tata Motors launched the 'XPRES' brand exclusively for fleet customers, and the XPRES-T EV is the first vehicle under this brand. The new XPRES-T electric sedan comes with 2 range options -- 315 km and 277 km, according to Tata Motors.",2023-02-23 10:24:03+05:30

Since its launch in October 2021, the Tata Punch has crossed the 6 lakh sales milestone.

This figure also includes the sales of its electric counterpart.

The Punch is available with a single petrol engine, which can also be had with a factory-fitted CNG kit.

The Punch EV, on the other hand, is offered with two battery pack options, delivering a claimed range of up to 365 km.

Prices for the Punch start from Rs 6 lakh (ex-showroom), while the Punch EV is priced from Rs 10 lakh (ex-showroom).

The micro-SUV offering from Tata Motors, the Tata Punch, has surpassed the 6 lakh sales milestone, becoming the fastest SUV in India to achieve this figure. Launched in the latter half of 2021, the Punch took less than four years to reach this mark. Its competitive price tag, well-equipped cabin, and the addition of an all-electric version have likely contributed to its strong appeal. That said, the 6 lakh sales figure also includes units of the Punch EV.

Below is the sales milestone achieved by both the Punch and Punch EV, since its launch date.

Month and Year Sales Milestone October 2021 Launch August 2022 1 Lakh May 2023 2 Lakh December 2023 3 Lakh July 2024 4 Lakh January 2025 5 Lakh July 2025 6 Lakh

Tata Motors' total PV sales stood at 35,299 units against 32,312 units by South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor India.

Similarly, Maruti Suzuki remains the top carmaker in the country with 123,016 units sold in December 2021.

Tata Motors also became the carmaker for posting the highest-ever quarterly sales from October to December of 2021 with 99,002 units. Shailesh Chandra, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors Ltd. said, “Tata Motors PV business growth journey continued and set several new milestones during the quarter despite witnessing a shortfall in production due to the ongoing semi-conductor crisis. Decade high quarterly and monthly sales- 99,002 units in Q3 FY22 (growth of 44% vs Q3 FY21) and 35,299 units in Dec’21 (growth of 50% vs Dec’20) were recorded.""

""In addition, the company also posted calendar year sale of 3,31,178 units (CY21), highest-ever since the inception of the PV Business. The overwhelming market response to Tata Punch launched in Oct’21 is further boosting demand for the

company’s 'New Forever' range of cars and SUVs. Records were also created on the EV front as EV sales witnessed a new peak of 5,592 units in Q3 FY22 (growth of 345% vs Q3 FY21). Consequently, EV penetration touched 5.6% of PV Sales during the quarter versus 1.8% in the same period last financial year,"" he added.

""EV sales also touched 10,000 units in 9MFY22 and crossed 2,000 monthly sales landmark for the first-time in Dec’21 (2,255 units). The ever-increasing demand for Nexon EV and Tigor EV as well as progressive revival of the EV fleet segment were instrumental in driving this steep growth. Going forward, semi-conductor supplies will remain the key source of uncertainty,"" Chandra added.

He further mentioned that additionally, the impact of the new strain of Covid needs to be closely tracked. We will continue to work on business agility plan and take proactive actions to mitigate these risks.

On the other hand, Hyundai Motor India Director (Sales, Marketing and Service) Tarun Garg told to PTI: ""We are entering 2022 with cautious optimism.

He noted that the company is taking various measures to improve customer experience at the dealerships.

The automaker is aiming at massive transformation in this regard, Chandra said.

Tata Motors has achieved a major milestone with the Punch, as the compact SUV has crossed the 6 lakh sales mark in less than four years since its launch in October 2021. This achievement not only sets a new record in the SUV category but also highlights Punch’s position as a game-changer in India’s passenger vehicle market.

India’s First Car – For Many

The Punch, which pioneered the sub-compact SUV segment, has found widespread appeal across diverse demographics and geographies — from metro cities to rural towns. Nearly 70% of Punch ICE customers are first-time car buyers, and 25% of Punch EV owners are women, indicating the vehicle’s inclusive design and usability. Ownership is evenly split with 24% from Tier 1 cities, 42% from Tier 2, and 34% from Tier 3 towns.

With its robust design, 5-star safety rating (GNCAP and BNCAP), and availability in petrol, CNG, and EV variants, the Punch has become Tata’s top-selling nameplate. It was India’s highest-selling car in CY2024 and currently holds a commanding 38% market share in the sub-compact SUV segment. Punch also contributes 36% to Tata Motors’ overall PV sales and has recorded 15% YoY growth.

Strong Rural & Urban Penetration

Speaking about the Punch, Vivek Srivatsa, Chief Commercial Officer, Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd., said, “The Punch embodies the spirit of a new India — bold, self- assured, and ready to forge its own path. Crossing the 6 lakh milestone is more than a production achievement; it’s a reflection of the immense trust that over 6 lakh Indians have placed in a vehicle that represents confidence, presence, and a fresh start to their journeys. It’s especially heartening to see how Punch has become the natural first choice for so many first-time car buyers. Punch is not just a car — it’s a breakthrough brand that has sparked a cultural shift and redefined what India expects from the first car in their family.

Celebrating the Milestone with “India Ki SUV” Campaign

With the launch of the ‘India Ki SUV’ campaign, we celebrate this extraordinary journey and the customers who made it possible. This is more than a celebration of numbers — it’s a tribute to a product that made SUV attitude accessible to all, without ever compromising on substance.”

From young professionals to growing families, the Punch has truly redefined what the first car in an Indian household can offer. With this record-setting feat, Tata Motors continues to build on Punch’s legacy — a bold, accessible, and safe SUV made for every Indian.",2025-07-17 10:47:17+00:00

The automaker sold 29,654 passenger vehicles last month reporting massive growth against the same period last year.

“The last two years have been difficult for the auto industry and seeing Tata Motors grow two-and-a-half times is something that makes me proud,” said Shailesh Chandra, managing director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility.

He made these comments whilst accepting the Manufacturer of the Year award on behalf of the company at the recent Autocar Awards 2022 ceremony. Ever since the pandemic engulfed the world in early 2020, Tata Motors has bucked the trend and outpaced the industry – with sales zooming from 1,31,197 units in FY20 to a projected 3,50,000 units in FY22, based on the current sales momentum.

The future looks bright

And now, with the dark clouds of the pandemic fast abating and the supply crunch of semiconductors easing, the company is gearing up for even more growth in a bullish market forecast to have clear skies ahead. According to industry sources, encouraged by strong demand across its product lines, Tata Motors has drawn up aggressive plans to produce over 5,00,000 cars a year. It is targeting sales of around 40,000 cars per month in the first few months of the next fiscal, rising to 50,000 units a month on the back of new launches, additional variants and facelifts later in the year.

Tata Motors is believed to be focusing on the Nexon, Altroz and Punch as the main volume drivers, since these are the most profitable models in its portfolio. Suppliers have been told to gear up for volumes of 15,000 Nexons per month, of which over 3,000 are likely to be the all-electric variant. The long-range Nexon EV, due in the first quarter of the next fiscal, is expected to further boost demand for Tata Motors’ (and India’s) bestselling EV.

The company also has an ambitious target to sell over 10,000 units each of the Altroz and Punch per month. The Altroz has finally got an automatic option, which should enhance demand, whilst the Punch is making strong inroads into the lower end of the compact SUV segment, where there isn’t too much competition. Whatever balance capacity remains will be used for the Harrier/Safari and Tigor/Tiago models.

Interestingly, Tata Motors has no all-new models planned next fiscal except for the Nexon Coupe, which, in essence, is a derivative of the current Nexon. The company appears to have prioritised investing in capacity over product development, and, as such, is close to acquiring Ford’s Sanand plant.

Sanand beckons

The Sanand plant will augment Tata Motors’ capacity by an additional 2,40,000 units to 7,20,000 units per annum. At present, the company has a capacity of 4,80,000 units across multiple plants. The Nexon is produced at the Ranjangaon plant near Pune, which is part of a manufacturing joint venture with Stellantis. The Pimpri plant at Pune is home to the Harrier, Safari, Altroz and Punch, while Tata’s own facility at Sanand (which was originally planned for the Nano), rolls out the Tiago and Tigor compact cars.

Once the Ford deal is sealed, the American automaker’s Sanand unit will, in all likelihood, be earmarked for new models across electric, CNG and the internal combustion engines. Tata is unlikely to produce its own engines at Ford’s Sanand plant, as the latter has already indicated that it will retain the engine manufacturing business for exports.

It now remains to be seen how quickly the transfer of ownership happens, even as sources reiterate that the Gujarat government will ensure a speedy transition, especially with the assembly elections scheduled to be held this year.

Incidentally, it was Gujarat which had literally laid out a red carpet for Tata Motors in 2008, when the company decided to slam the brakes on the Nano project in West Bengal. The government wasted little time in offering Sanand as an alternative location and this became home to the people’s car.

Since then, Gujarat has attracted more brands, and just last week, Maruti-Suzuki announced an investment of Rs 10,440 crore in EV and battery manufacturing.

As for Ford, it still has its other facility at Maraimalai Nagar near Chennai, where the Tamil Nadu government is anxious to find a buyer. In fact, recent meetings between Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran and Chief Minister MK Stalin sparked speculation that the company was considering this plant, but it was never an option for Tata Motors.

“The Maraimalai Nagar plant does not have the desired flexibility in manufacturing and can only make two models, which ruled it out,” said a Ford source. “The Sanand facility in comparison is a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility which Tata Motors could get for a bargain.”

Slow and steady…

However, the Sanand plant too poses its own set of challenges, which is why Tata Motors has not been in a rush to snap it up. Built to Ford’s global standards, it has a body shop with over 90 percent robotisation. Whilst this level bodes well for quality and productivity, sources say that it requires “a minimum volume of 1,00,000 units a year for operational breakeven”.

But given the strong pull on current products and a slew of EVs planned in the coming years, Tata Motors is confident about mopping up the big jump in capacity the Sanand plant brings. There’s no doubt that Tata Motors is on a roll. It overtook Hyundai as the number two player in December 2021, and given the company’s sales trajectory, this decade could see the stakes shift in favour of Tata Motors as a serious rival to market leader Maruti Suzuki.",

However, the brokerage sees some weakness in the stock and trimmed its EPS forecast until FY27.

Can Anything Stop It?","The Nexon, which launched in 2017, the Harrier in 2019, and the Altroz in January 2020, contribute to over 60 percent of company sales

Tata Motors is on a roll. Months after it set up a subsidiary that has become India’s most valuable EV (electric vehicle) company, the automaker has raced past Hyundai Motors to become India’s second-largest carmaker. In December 2021, Tata Motors sold as many as 35,300 units of vehicles, up from 23,545 units a year ago. In contrast, Hyundai sold 32,312 units during the same period.

Between October and December, Tata Motors sold 99,002 units of passenger vehicles (PV), up by almost 45 percent from the year-ago period.

“Tata Motors’ PV business growth journey continued and set several new milestones during the quarter despite witnessing a shortfall in production due to the ongoing semiconductor crisis,” Shailesh Chandra, president of the PV business, said in a statement. “Decade-high quarterly and monthly sales were recorded. In addition, the company also posted calendar year (CY21) sales of 331,178 units, the highest since the inception of the PV business.”

The phenomenal rise to the second-highest automaker comes at a time when Tata Motors has a backlog of some 100,000 vehicles after supplies were affected due to a global shortage of semiconductors. India’s automobile industry is grappling with a shortage of semiconductors, and has a backlog of over 600,000 vehicles for delivery. Semiconductors are critical components that are used in vehicles for numerous features, including navigation, infotainment and traction control, among others.

In October, the company, despite challenges, had also launched the Tata Punch, a small SUV, as it looks to capitalise on the boom in the Indian SUV market.

“Of course, December was an exception,” says Puneet Gupta, director for automotive forecasting at market research firm IHS Markit. “But one thing is clear. You cannot underestimate Tata Motors now. It has been very consistent with its launches, and they have scaled their presence in the fastest growing segments in the industry. Its recent launches have all been successful.” The Nexon, which launched in 2017, the Harrier in 2019, and the Altroz in January 2020, contribute to over 60 percent of company sales. Of that, Altroz and Harrier were manufactured on the Alfa and Omega platforms, respectively. The two platforms, the first of which was introduced in 2018 on the Harrier and later the Altroz, marked a shift in the company’s practice of developing specific platforms for every model. There is also the company’s hatchback, Tiago—initially named Zica—that has been holding steady in terms of sales, and clocking over 6,000 units a month since the past few years. “The overwhelming market response to Tata Punch launched in October is further boosting demand for the company’s ‘New Forever’ range of cars and SUVs,” adds Chandra. Tata’s New Forever range has played a significant role in its much-celebrated turnaround as a carmaker, after decades of struggle. The new range of vehicles boasts high safety standards, better engine performance, and driving pleasure, aesthetic design, and rich features, in comparison to some of its previous models. Meanwhile, in December, the automaker, which currently controls some 75 percent of the Indian EV market, sold 2,255 units of vehicles, up by some 439 percent, compared to the year-ago period. Between October and December, Tata Motors sold 5,592 units of EVs, up by 345 percent. The company is also ramping up its CNG presence, with the launch of a range of CNG vehicles that have found traction in recent times. “Consequently, EV penetration touched 5.6 percent of PV sales during the quarter versus 1.8 percent in the same period in the last financial year,” says Chandra. “EV sales also touched 10,000 units in 9MFY22 and crossed 2,000 monthly sales landmark for the first time in December (2,255 units). The ever-increasing demand for Nexon EV and Tigor EV, as well as progressive revival of the EV fleet segment were instrumental in driving this steep growth.” In October, Tata Motors had raised $1 billion from private equity major TPG Rise Climate for its yet-to-be operational EV subsidiary, valuing it at over $9 billion. Tata Motors will invest $2 billion into the subsidiary over the next five years. The new company, Tata Motors believes, will leverage all the existing investments and capabilities of the parent company, in addition to channelising all the future investments into EVs and dedicated battery vehicle platforms and technologies, among others. Over the next five years, the company will also create a portfolio of 10 EVs while also partnering with Tata Power to create charging infrastructure to help with early adoption. Tata Motors Will invest $2 billion into the EV subsidiary over the next five years “We see a very positive outlook for Tata Motors,” says Harshvardhan Sharma, head of auto retail practice at Nomura Research Institute. “At the moment, Tata Motors is being fuelled by tremendous growth by deploying stupendous efforts in electrical mobility segment. As a conglomerate, it is utilising all synergies across its group companies to solve the value chain requirements from battery, charging stations all the way till new tech hardware and software required for EVs. At the same time, with a fresh portfolio of SUV range, it is catering to both ends of the market and successfully navigating its growth.” “Over the past few years, the messaging from Tata Motors has been very consistent,” adds Gupta. “They are a complete package with focus on quality, value for money, technology and design. Dealers and suppliers have also been rather excited about their comeback. That also means companies such as Hyundai will now have to stretch themselves and focus on ways to take on the Tata might.” Yet, over the next few months, as the global semiconductor concerns recede, Tata Motors might lose the second spot to Hyundai. “Going forward, semiconductor supplies will remain the key source of uncertainty,” Chandra said in a statement. “Additionally, the impact of the new strain of Covid needs to be closely tracked. We will continue to work on business agility plan and take proactive actions to mitigate these risks.” Meanwhile, it is not just the PV segment in which the company has shown stellar performance. The company’s commercial vehicle segment also posted a 24 percent sales growth in December, with sales at 66,307 units. “Construction and infrastructure spending by central and state governments plus rising activity in sectors such as mining, petroleum-oil-lubricants and allied industries facilitated the demand for M&HCVs,” Girish Wagh, executive director, Tata Motors, said in a statement.",

Tata Sons Ltd, the parent of Tata Motors, is also exploring opportunities to invest in manufacturing lithium-ion cells in India and Europe to forge a proper supply chain for its zero-emission vehicles in the coming decade, said N. Chandrasekaran, who is also the chairman of Tata Sons that controls the diversified Tata group.

With governments worldwide pushing companies to develop and produce EVs to reduce carbon footprint, automakers are focusing on offering sustainable mobility solutions, including more battery-electric and hybrid-electric offerings.

“In India, EV penetration in our portfolio has doubled to 2% this year, and we expect penetration to increase exponentially in the coming years. Tata Motors will lead this change in the Indian market. By 2025, Tata Motors will have 10 new BEV (battery electric vehicles), and as a group, we will invest proactively to set up charging infrastructure across the country,” Chandrasekaran said in the company’s annual report for 2020-21.

He said Tata Sons is evaluating the creation of an automotive software and engineering vertical within Tata group that will help it lead in the sphere of connected and autonomous vehicles.

Tata Motors currently makes the Nexon EV model under its namesake brand. Its UK unit Jaguar Land Rover produces the I-Pace electric vehicle models.

Earlier this year, JLR announced its pivot towards a fully electric future through the ‘Re-imagine strategy’ wherein the company will reposition and redesign Jaguar as an all-electric luxury car brand by 2025. Likewise, Land Rover will evolve as a maker of luxury electric sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).

EVs will form 60% of Land Rover’s annual sales by 2030. JLR expects to stop sales of combustion engine vehicles by 2036 as part of its aim to become a ‘net zero carbon business’ by 2039.

JLR also announced its decision to write-off investments worth ₹15,000 crore earmarked for developing internal combustion vehicles, which became unviable after its move towards electric vehicle technology.

Chandrasekaran said Tata Motors is in the process of adapting its underlying business model towards sustainable mobility, with JLR targeting zero tailpipe emissions for all models it sells by 2036.

“With these moves, Tata Motors will be well placed to meet the opportunities that arise from these fundamental shifts. Your company will be the torch-bearer for green mobility in the automotive world and create a virtuous cycle of growth and returns for our shareholders, too,” he added.

The Mumbai-based automaker reported a strong recovery in its operating performance in the third and fourth quarters of FY21, backed by higher sales of JLR vehicles in key markets. It, however, does not expect the growth momentum to continue in the near term as production is likely to be hit by a global shortage of semi-conductor parts, a critical component in modern vehicles.",2021-06-28 17:28:53+05:30
https://www.financialexpress.com/business/express-mobility-tata-motors-is-expanding-its-talent-base-via-innovation-opportunities-and-upskilling-says-hr-chief-2671701/,"Tata Motors is expanding its talent base via innovation, opportunities and upskilling, says HR Chief","What are the key general skills that you look at while hiring freshers?

At Tata Motors, when looking for the right talent, we seek to determine how they fit in terms of our vision and ethos. While education and qualifications are still at the top of our list when hiring new employees, empathy and social skills have generally been the deciding factors, especially in this post-Covid era. Additionally, we have been investing in individuals who have an agile and adaptable mindset so they can learn new technologies and develop skills necessary for the effective use of emerging tools in their work.

What skills and qualities do you look for in employees?

Rapid digital transformation and the emergence of Industry 4.0 have intimated us to prioritise and cultivate skills suited to meet the fast-changing needs of the auto sector. Along with looking for individuals with soft skills such as strong communication and a problem-solving mindset, we actively seek people who can deftly adapt to the automated processes and robotics employed on the shop floor.

Autonomous, Connected, Electric and Shared (ACES) are the four technology-driven mega trends that will determine the future of the automotive industry, and as such, we are looking for people who bring skills and knowledge in these areas.

Biswaroop Mukherjee: “The educational curriculum must be designed taking into consideration the technical skills and job profiles in demand.”

What are the challenges you face when hiring new talent?

There is a shortage of ‘experienced’ talent in auto electric and electronics area. In addition to existing players the numerous ‘start ups’ who have entered the field and the demand for talent is fuelling attrition. Moreover, there is a supply challenge, the education curriculum from ITIs (Industrial Training Institute’s) to MTech needs a revision to ready graduating students for the ACES world.

Do you think there is a gap between academia and industry? How can this be bridged?

A dynamic and competitive business landscape has compelled organisations to continually invest in young, specialised, ready talent. However, because of the way traditional education is set up, it is difficult for organisations to build and sustain a pipeline of competent individuals. There is a growing disconnect between what students learn and the skills required to address real-life workplace challenges.

The educational curriculum must be designed taking into consideration the technical skills and job profiles in demand. Additionally, academic institutions must collaborate with businesses to create programmes that provide students the chance to experience Industry 4.0 directly and learn how to put their newly gained knowledge into practice. These early experiences can set the base for an individual’s growth in the future.

What are you doing to attract, train and retain young professionals?

Growth and culture are key to the employee value proposition. At Tata Motors, our endeavour has been to provide every person with the opportunity to realise their full potential.

We encourage employees to pursue growth opportunities by exploring open roles, and as our business is on a growth trajectory, we have numerous opportunities. We also provide job rotation and opportunities for them to work on projects outside of their current roles through a structured programme, allowing them to develop new skills or gain exposure.

We are in the midst of a cultural refresh programme that has been carefully crafted with the active participation of all employees across the board.

What is your hiring target for FY2023?

Tata Motors is expanding, and we have been hiring for a while now. We are continuously seeking quality talent at all levels for various functions such as Advance Engineering, Product Development, P&SQ, Supply Chain, Operations, and Commercial functions. ACES will be the future of the industry, and we are accordingly expanding our talent pool by bringing in individuals with similar skills.

Tata Motors shopfloor.

Are there any additional training programs or courses that you have incorporated to upskill your existing workforce?

We are constantly investing in upskilling our employees in ACES . This initiative is not limited to manufacturing functions, electric vehicles or specific levels, but extends to all functions – from Engineering and R&D to Sourcing, Manufacturing, Sales, Service (including training dealer and service partners), for all our employees, from shopfloor associates to senior management, across CV, PV and EV businesses.

We have developed the ‘Future of Workplace’ strategy to address the rapid technology disruptions and changing market dynamics. It equips our workforce with in-demand skills such as High Voltage (electric vehicles), Mechatronics (Industry 4.0), Auto Electronics and Vehicle Communication. Parallelly, we are building a young, competent, adaptable and digitally enabled workforce through our organisation’s flagship full-time apprenticeship programme.

How do you ensure to retain your hardworking employees? Are fiscal incentives the only way to motivate employees?

Our greatest asset is our people. We are committed to fostering an environment at work that inspires them to discover and realise their full potential. By acquiring a variety of experiences, completing challenging tasks, and consistently learning and upskilling, they are equipped to perform their best. We encourage them to establish rewarding careers and become future-ready by identifying, nurturing and developing quality talent at every stage of the employee lifecycle.

We have embraced the post-pandemic way of life and work while putting employee well-being first. We are collectively promoting new working practices by institutionalising hybrid modes of working, digitising procedures and refreshing our culture.

These adjustments encourage employees to adopt innovative working practises and give them a feeling of purpose within the company, which helps businesses retain their people and close the talent gap from within.

Automotive industry has one of the most diverse workforces.

What are the policies laid down to ensure work-life balance for your employees?

At Tata Motors, we have shifted to a hybrid working model since Feb 2021, which we believe will be the future of work.

Our focus is on fostering a flexible and adaptive work culture for our employees. We have been cognisant of the necessity of incorporating inclusivity and a culture of sustainable well-being for a thriving work organisation. The hybrid model has also emerged as a cost-effective combination of working out of an office and from home.",

The company had sold 43,704 units in June 2021.Domestic sales of passenger vehicles were up 87% to 45,197 units in the month under review, compared to 24,110 units in June last year. This includes 41,690 units of ICE vehicles and 3,507 units of EVs in June 2022.For Q1 FY23, the company’s domestic sales stood at 1,30,125 units as against 64,386 units in the corresponding quarter of FY22. Shailesh Chandra , Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd, said, “Demand for passenger vehicles continued to stay strong in Q1 FY23 even as the supply side remained moderately impacted due to the lockdown in China. Overcoming the challenges, Tata Motors posted record-breaking monthly sales (June’22) as well as quarterly sales (Q1 FY23).”“Our SUV portfolio contributed 68% of Q1FY23 sales. Electric vehicle sales attained new heights with quarterly sales of 9,283 in Q1 FY23 and highest-ever monthly sales of 3,507 units in June '22. Nexon EV Max launched in May '22, has witnessed strong demand. Going forward, we expect the supply side, including that of critical electronic components to progressively improve. We will continue to keep a close watch on the evolving demand and supply situation and take appropriate actions,” he said.For the commercial vehicles, the automaker reported a growth of 76% to 34,409 units in June this year as against 19,594 units in June 2021.Export of CVs was also up 14% to 2,856 units last month, as compared to 2,506 units in the corresponding month of 2021. Girish Wagh , Executive Director, Tata Motors Ltd, said, “The growth in Q1 has been broad-based across regions and segments. The M&HCV and I&LCV segments grew by 104% and 138%, respectively, over the same quarter (Q1) last year on the back of increased activity in road construction, mining, and growth in agriculture and e-commerce. SCV demand from last-mile distribution has remained robust backed by continued consumer spending.”“CV Passenger saw a strong recovery, with a 57% increase over Q4 FY22, due to the opening of schools and replacement of staff buses. The International Business declined by 23% over Q1 FY22, majorly due to a drop in industry volume on account of the financial crisis in Sri Lanka and Nepal. Going ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about overall demand while keeping a close watch on interest rates, transporter profitability, commodity prices and semiconductor availability,” he said.",

For Tata Motors, the launch of the Nexon turned its fortunes around. Since its market debut in 2017, the Tata Nexon has achieved total sales of 7 lakh units. The Nexon is no doubt Tata’s best-selling product in recent times, owing to its various powertrain options, including two all-electric variants.

The Tata Nexon journey

The Tata Nexon took 25 months to reach the first 1 lakh milestone, and in May 2021, the Nexon achieved its 2 lakh sales milestone. In the next 10 months, the Nexon achieved its 3 lakh sales milestone, while it took the company another 7 months to reach the 4 lakh sales milestone.

In April 2023, the Nexon achieved the 5 lakh sales milestone, while in December 2023, Tata Motors achieved the 6 lakh sales milestone of the Nexon. And now, in June 2024, the Nexon sales has reached its highest at 7 lakh units. Along the way, the Nexon saw minor updates and the introduction of an all-electric version. In 2023, the Nexon saw its biggest update, alongside its EV variants.

Speaking on the occasion, Vivek Srivatsa, Chief Commercial Officer, Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, said, “Since its launch in 2017, the Nexon has set new standards in design, safety, comfort and driving pleasure. Over the past seven years, the unwavering support and love of its expanding customer base have made the Nexon an iconic brand in the industry.”

He added, “With a wide choice of powertrains and personas, we have ensured that there is an ideal Nexon for every evolving need and discerning choice of our customers. To celebrate this landmark achievement of 7 lakh sales in 7 years and to express our sincere gratitude to the growing Nexon family, we are passing on exciting price benefits for both existing and new customers.”",
https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/electric-vehicle-production-to-get-priority-over-other-cars-tata-motors/article64926283.ece,Electric vehicle production to get priority over other cars: Tata Motors,"Unabated demand for electric cars has forced Tata Motors, India’s third largest car-maker, to accord priority on the production lines in its factories which also manufactures petrol and diesel-powered vehicles.

The Mumbai-based company is operating its plants at ‘high utilisation levels’ presently and therefore will have to adjust production of its electric cars with those which are powered by fossil fuels to meet demand.

With a share of more than 70 per cent, Tata Motors is the market leader in the electric four-wheeler segment. While at present it has two models that are powered by batteries – Nexon and Tigor – but the number of offerings is expected to touch 10 models in the next three years.

Demand growth

Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, said, “We will have to prioritise EVs given that it is in a steep growth phase. We are going through a demand discovery phase and to ensure that we unleash the full demand potential it is quite logical to give certain priority to EV and that is what we are doing.”

Tata Motors’ electric vehicle company, in which the investors TPG Rise Climate and ADQ own 11-15 per cent stake, does not have any factories of its own. It has to rely on the production facilities of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles for supplies.

While Tata Motors’ non-electric vehicles are also facing huge waiting periods extending to beyond 4 months the waiting on the electric models are around six months.

Robust order book

It is presently accepting bookings for EVs which are 60 per cent more than its peak delivery capacity. “The order book is extremely healthy. For EVs, we have a monthly rate of bookings which is near 3,500 units and we did a peak supply of 2,200 in December,” Chandra added.

As of December 2021, the share of EVs in Tata Motors’ total domestic passenger vehicle sales stood at 6 per cent, which has been the highest since the company’s entry into EVs in January 2020. This share is only heading north with the introduction of new models and expansion of markets.

“Oneout of five vehicles should be an EV in the next five years which translates to 20 per cent penetration. We only have two EVs from the seven offerings we have which has given us a six per cent penetration. The penetration of electric in Nexon and Tigor is more than 15 per cent. As we move forward, as we electrify more models, this percentage is going to increase,” Chandra added.

While Chandra refused to share the actual installed production capacity of Tata Motors, he admitted that there is high utilisation levels of all of its passenger car producing factories. As per the latest information shared by Tata Motors Chief Financial Officer PB Balaji, the company has an installed capacity of 480,000 units a year or 40,000 units a month. The company sold nearly 35,300 in December 2021.

“We have undertaken de-bottlenecking actions (of production lines). The utilisation levels are quite high but we also have a partner capacity in Ranjangaon, which we try to leverage on, because there was spare capacity available. But it is true that our capacity utilisation levels used to be very low,” Chandra added.

The new year has started with a bang. Most of the carmakers are quite happily launching their new products in the Indian market. Few have also announced their plans for this year, and needless to say 2021 looks choc-a-block. No, we aren’t complaining and manufacturers that have consistently seen a slump, like Nissan India, too have something to cheer this month. We will come to that in a bit. Let’s start from the top of the table. It is again (no surprises) dominated by Maruti Suzuki. In January 2021, more than 1.39 lakh cars were sold by India’s largest four-wheeler maker. Last year, 1,39,844 units were sold. This resulted in a degrowth of 0.60 per cent year on year. Hyundai, Maruti’s arch rival, sold 52,005 cars last month.

Mahindra and Mahindra too grew by 4.82 per cent. The SUV maker managed to sell 20,498 cars last month as opposed to 19,555 sold in 2020.

Honda is followed by Toyota and Renault that posted a growth of 91.7 as well as 5.18 per cent, respectively.

The star of the month though is Nissan India. The company managed to move 4,527 cars and in the process, posting a whopping 220 per cent growth rate. This growth can be attributed to the Nissan Magnite, a SUV which boasts of new features as well as efficient engines.

It is indeed a welcome sight to see the Indian auto industry healing and recovering. With the influx of fresh as well as all-new models, customers are all the more attracted to owning a car. The pandemic, it must be added, has only accelerated the adoption of a new vehicle.",

Records were also created on the EV front as EV sales witnessed a new peak of 5,592 units in Q3 FY22 (growth of 345% vs Q3 FY21).”

He further added, “Consequently, EV penetration touched 5.6% of PV Sales during the quarter versus 1.8% in the same period last financial year. EV sales also touched 10,000 units in 9MFY22 and crossed 2,000 monthly sales landmark for the first time in Dec’21 (2,255 units). The ever-increasing demand for Nexon EV and Tigor EV as well as progressive revival of the EV fleet segment were instrumental in driving this steep growth. Going forward, semiconductor supplies will remain the key source of uncertainty. Additionally, the impact of the new strain of Covid needs to be closely tracked. We will continue to work on a business agility plan and take proactive actions to mitigate these risks.”",

Tata Motors dominates the electric passenger vehicle segment in India with its Nexon EV and the recently-launched Tigor EV. The company has been at the forefront of the EV revolution in the country and now, Tata’s EV division has achieved some big milestones too. In December 2021, Tata Motors managed to sell 2,255 EVs, achieving its highest-ever EV sales in a month.

While M&M will launch the electric version of XUV400 in the second week of September, Tata Motors is working on several parameters to bring down the cost of EV ownership.

A new electric car is being planned at a price point lower than the flagship Nexon, which is likely to be launched soon, Shailesh Chandra, managing director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd, said in an interview.

Tata Motors, which had 88% share of the electric passenger vehicle market in Q1FY23, is looking to woo the price-sensitive Indian consumer with Generation-1 and Generation-2 EVs at affordable prices over the next 12-18 months.

It is also set to launch the mid-sized electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) Tata Curvv in 2024, and its born electric, or Generation-3 EV range based on the AVINYA concept in 2025.

For Tata Motors, existing models like the Nexon EV and Tigor EV, are Gen-1 products as they’re based on existing IC-engine powertrains. Gen-2 products will be built on an upgraded platform, which is optimized for EVs, but can be utilized for both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric models.

The carmaker will look to launch two new electric vehicles every year, or 10 new EVs, in the next five years, said Chandra. The model “more affordable” than its best-selling Nexon EV, is in the works and could be announced by the end of the year and , hit the market early next year, he said.

The new car could be based on the Tata Punch micro-SUV, said an industry insider, seeking anonymity.

“The cars will be at different affordability points from where the affordability for EVs starts today, and we have planned the sequence of the launches to give us the right spread of products we have. We will also bring feature-upgraded products,” Chandra added.

Tata Motors’ long-range Nexon EV Max starts at an ex-showroom price of ₹17.7 lakh. Experts said M&M’s upcoming e-SUV XUV400, which is based on the XUV300 platform, may be offered at a similar price. The average waiting period for Nexon EV is six months.

Tata Motors is banking on a cycle of product refresh, which will hit the market next year onwards to keep attracting customers, even as its competitors launch a slew of new vehicles, particularly, SUVs.

Expanding powertrain options with CNG variants of existing models will be another important growth area for Tata Motors, said Chandra.

As competition intensifies in the EV segment leading up to 2024-25, when mass-market players will have multiple EVs built on dedicated, ground-up EV platforms, Tata Motors is betting on its high-intensity of launches to retain its leadership position.",

Altroz EV launch delayed as company waits for market stability. With Tiago.ev and Punch.ev already in lineup, Tata leads India’s EV space amid shifting dynamics and price drops in electric vehicle components.

Tata Motors is planning to roll out another affordable electric vehicle model, as its competitors focus on mid and premium segments.

The company is waiting for the market to stabilise for the launch of the Altroz EV, which has been in the works for a few years.

Vivek Srivatsa, chief commercial officer, Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, said, “We have a couple of products catering to the Rs 8-11-lakh price band. We want Altroz (EV) to play a specific role. We have two products where Altroz (EV) was supposed to be. We will wait for the right time when there is a proper role for Altroz in the portfolio and also for the EV category to stabilise.”

Tata Motors’ EV product portfolio was conceptualised in 2020-21 with proper differentiation between models and in-between addressable markets. The EV market has undergone a significant change since, with the prices of batteries and other aggregates coming down.

“Price erosion has taken place much faster than anticipated in the EV segment. Hence, we don’t want to rush in and create more confusion in the category,” Srivatsa added.

With five EVs, Tata Motors has the largest portfolio of passenger battery electric vehicles in India. Its price range starts at Rs 7.99 lakh for the Tiago.ev and goes up to Rs 17.49 lakh for the Curvv.ev. Under Rs 11 lakh, the Mumbai-based company’s second product is the Punch.ev.

On Thursday, an updated version of the Altroz premium hatchback powered by petrol, diesel and CNG engines was launched with prices starting at Rs 6.89 lakh (petrol model, ex-showroom). The model will compete against the segment best-sellers Maruti Suzuki Baleno and Hyundai Elite i20. This is the first major update for the model since its debut in early 2020.

The premium hatchback segment generates a monthly volume of more than 30,000 units. From a peak of 25% in 2023, Tata Motors’ share in this segment has dropped to 12%. The company is confident of pushing its share to 30% with the latest launch.

“The hatchback segment will stabilise at around 20% of the industry’s volume and within that the premium hatchback segment will grow to close to 50%. Volume growth is not there. Last couple of years the segment has seen degrowth. However, the segment will stabilise,” Srivatsa added.",
